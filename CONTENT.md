About
-----
Consumer expectations in terms of  taste, freshness, and availability of 
fruit and veg are rising. Yet delivering quality in the times of pandemics, 
globalized supply chains, and changing weather patterns in the production 
regions is more challenging than ever before. Suppliers worldwide lose 
billions in product rejections, price renegotiations, and food waste. 
At the same time the consumers are left with sub-optimal products at a high 
price.

The world is ripe for better quality management in fresh.

Agrinorm is a Swiss based deep tech company leveraging cutting edge machine 
learning techniques for the optimization of fruit and veg supply chains. 
We develop technology that enables our customers to excel in quality of fresh 
produce and achieve price leadership while reducing environmental impact.

Executive Team

nutritious, sustainably produced fruits and vegetables to consumers.
